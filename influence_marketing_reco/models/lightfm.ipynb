    "# LightFM model for influence marketing\n",
    "Using a LightFM model for recommending influencers to companies and brands can help identify influencers who are likely to have a positive impact on the target audience and improve the effectiveness of the influence marketing campaign. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will conduct the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect data about the influencers and their social media activity, and data about companies and brands.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Preprocess the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Define the problem: Relate and give a score to the relationships between companies and influencers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Build the model. The model can be trained using the collected data and can then be used to make recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Evaluate the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use the model for influence marketing. Once the model is trained and evaluated, use it to make personalized recommendations to companies and brands, suggesting a list of influencers who are a good fit for the brand and campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "In further steps, we will monitor and adjust the model (updating the data, retraining the model, or tweaking the parameters)."

    "### Model theoretical explanation\n",
    "In general, recommendation models can be divided into two categories: content-based and collaborative filtering. Content-based models recommend based on the similarity of items or users using their description or metadata. Collaborative filtering models compute the latent factors of users and items based on the assumption that people who express similar opinions on one item will have similar opinions on other items. The choice between the two models depends on data availability, with collaborative filtering being effective when sufficient ratings or feedbacks are available, and content-based models being useful when there is a lack of ratings and metadata is available. Content-based models are also useful for addressing cold-start issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address cold-start issues, hybrid approaches have been proposed that combine content-based and collaborative filtering. One such approach is the hybrid matrix factorization model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LightFM** is a Python implementation of a hybrid recommendation algorithm for both implicit and explicit feedbacks. It is a content-collaborative model that represents users and items as linear combinations of their content features’ latent factors. User and item embeddings are estimated for every feature, and these features are added together to be the final representations for users and items. LightFM computes the representation for each item and user by retrieving the corresponding row or column in the feature matrix and adding together the embeddings for features with non-zero weights. The resulting representations produce scores for every item for a given user, with highly scored items being more likely to be interesting to the user.\n",
    "\n",
